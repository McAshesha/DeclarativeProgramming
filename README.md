# 📚 Declarative Programming Assignments with Haskell&SQL 🌟

Hello! I’m Ковалёв В. Я. from group 24940 ИИР, and this repository contains my solutions to various **declarative programming** tasks in Haskell&SQL. Get ready to dive into the world of functional programming!

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo is divided into two main parts for your convenience:

- `1_sem/` – All tasks for the 1st semester

Within the semester, you'll find **homeworks** and **lessons** directories to keep everything nice and organized.

### 🗂️ Example Structure:
```bash
.
├── 1_sem/
│   ├── homeworks/
│   │   ├── 1-simple_function/
│   │   │   ├── solution.hs  # Solution to Simple Function Task
│   │   │   └── task.pdf     # Task description
│   │   └── 2-recursion/     # ...
│   ├── lectures/
│   │   ├── L01.pdf          # Lecture 1
│   │   ├── L02.pdf          # Lecture 2
│   │   └── -.pdf            # ...
│   └── lessons/
│       ├── 1-introduction_simple_function/
│       │   ├── solution.hs  # Solution for introductory lesson on simple functions
│       │   └── task.pdf     # Task description
│       └── 2-recursion/     # ...
├── 2_sem/                   # 2 semester
│   ├── homeworks/
│   │   ├── .../
│   ├── lectures/
│   │   ├── ...    
│   └── lessons/
│       ├── .../     
├── haskell_book.pdf         # Haskell book for reference
└── README.md                # This README file
```

## 🛠️ How to Use

Clone this repo using your favorite terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McAshesha/DeclarativeProgramming.git
```
Navigate to the specific semester, homework, or lesson you're interested in.

Run the Haskell files using GHCi or compile them:
```bash
ghci
:l /path/to/solution.hs
```
or
```bash
ghci solution.hs
```
or
```bash
runhaskell solution.hs
```

## 🤖 What’s Inside?

Each folder is organized by topics like simple functions or recursion, and each `solution.hs` file contains my approach to solving the tasks. If you find something quirky, remember it's Haskell's way of keeping things interesting! 😉

## 📘 Additional Resources

- **Haskell Book**: Check out `haskell_book.pdf` in the root of the repository for an in-depth guide to Haskell.
- **Haskell Wiki**: Visit [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.nsunc.com/_export/html/haskell#haskellvvedenie_v_funkcionalnoe_programmirovanie) for more insights and tutorials on functional programming.

## 💡 Notes:

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, but don’t copy them directly! Haskell&SQL is all about understanding the concepts. If you spot a mistake or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue!
Let the functional magic guide you! 🌟
